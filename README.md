# Height-Weight Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates **Linear Regression** using Python.  
The goal is to predict a person's **weight** based on their **height** using a simple machine learning model.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Implemented **Simple Linear Regression** from scratch and using libraries.
- Explored the relationship between `Height` and `Weight`.
- Evaluated model performance using **R-squared** and other metrics.
- Visualized regression line fit on data.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.12**
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - statsmodels

📊 Results

Built a linear regression model using scikit-learn and statsmodels.
Achieved good accuracy for height → weight prediction.
Visualized regression line over scatter plot of data.
